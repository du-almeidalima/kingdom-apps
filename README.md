# Kingdom Apps

Welcome to the Kingdom Apps monorepo!

This monorepo contains projects aimed to help the ministry and congregation work.
Although its purpose is related to Jehovah's Witnesses organization work, this is not associated by any means with the 
Jehovah Witness and any of its trademarks.

## Structure

This monorepo is divided in Apps and Libs.

- __Apps__ are the deployable application that the end user is going to use; that includes the Ministry Maps project.
- __Libs__ are shareable code that applications can import and use, those are not deployable and shouldn't contain application-specific logic.

## Prerequisites

To run and deploy the Kingdom Apps monorepo, you will need:
- Node.js - 18~
- NPM - 9~
- [Firebase Tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools)

You will also need to set the environment variables. Reach out to a maintainer for those.


## Projects

- Ministry Maps: PWA application to manage territory and designations for the ministry service.

## Development

To run the application:

Run `nx serve ministry-maps` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
